## Guess the word
An elm "app". 
 - Loads scrabble words, 
 - chooses a random word
 - allows player to continually enter random words 
 - shows wether entered worth is alphabetically before or after selected word
 - player wins when entered word matches selected word


The enitire logic is in `src/Main.elm` and can be run with `elm reactor` (in fact, this *is* the only way I've tested it)
Read elm docs for generating html + js.
